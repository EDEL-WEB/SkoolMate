# Security Improvements - Authentication System

## Changes Made

### üîí **Removed Insecure Login Endpoint**
- **REMOVED**: `/auth/simple-login` endpoint that allowed anyone to login as admin without credentials
- **REASON**: This endpoint was a major security vulnerability that bypassed all authentication

### ‚úÖ **Enforced Proper Authentication**
- **UPDATED**: Frontend now uses `/auth/login` endpoint that validates email and password
- **VERIFIED**: Password hashing is properly implemented using Werkzeug's security functions
- **CONFIRMED**: JWT tokens are required for all protected routes

### üõ°Ô∏è **Role-Based Access Control**
- **VERIFIED**: Admin routes are protected with `@admin_required` decorator
- **VERIFIED**: Teacher routes are protected with `@teacher_required` decorator
- **CONFIRMED**: Decorators check both JWT validity and user role

## Current Admin Credentials
- **Email**: `admin@school.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: `admin`

## Security Features Now Active

1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash()`
2. **JWT Authentication**: All protected routes require valid JWT tokens
3. **Role Verification**: Routes check user roles before granting access
4. **Credential Validation**: Login endpoint validates email/password combinations
5. **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens have built-in expiration handling

## How Authentication Now Works

1. User submits email/password via login form
2. Backend validates credentials against database
3. If valid, JWT token is generated and returned
4. Frontend stores token and includes it in subsequent requests
5. Protected routes verify token and user role before allowing access

## No More Security Vulnerabilities

‚ùå **BEFORE**: Anyone could access admin functions without authentication
‚úÖ **AFTER**: Only authenticated users with proper roles can access protected resources

The system now properly authenticates users and prevents unauthorized access to admin functions.
